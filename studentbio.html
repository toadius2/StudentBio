    <p>I am just a guy taking a computer progamming bootcamp as a career change opporunity.
       I have many other interests, from creative writing, singing, video games, etc. 
       I went to UCLA for undergrad and majored in music history, and ended up going to
       USC as a post-bac in their pre-med program. I recently went on a leave of absence,
       however, so now I am here.
